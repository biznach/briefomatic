The organizers, some reportedly working at major US AI firms, say the goal is to expose AI’s ‘Achilles’ heel’ and encourage active resistance to large-scale model deployment, though the scope and impact of the effort remain unclear.",

While GPUs will continue to dominate the overall AI server market, MIC says ASICs are increasingly favored for inference because of their efficiency, lower power consumption, and suitability for fixed, cost-sensitive workloads, with Taiwanese manufacturers poised to expand into this segment.",
